# AmbIence

Check other branches for more code design and implementations

Automating personal assistant with AI aimed for college students that allocates your "free/open" time for completion of objectives.

Break it down by semesters. Import information regarding course schedule (whether class is virtual or irl, if the latter, AmbIence would automate and fill the respective time frames in the calendar). E.G. User has class Goverment lecture Tuesdays and Thursdays 10:00-11:15 am, after importing course schedule AmbIence would automatically fill in those time blocks.

Features:


"Set Environment" 
  - Similar to iOS notifcation control, it allows us to select different "modes" to avoid distraction and enhance the completion or advancement of tasks. It would allow the user to have "productivity" enhancing music, or give the user an option to import their music streaming service. As well as giving the user a background visual of their choice (beach, rain, snow) to block out outside distractions.
  
"Individual" or "Group" Calendar View
  - It is standard and expected to be group work throughout college, and a big issue encountered is the compatibility of schedules between teammates. This app would import the availabilty of each individual in the group, automazing it and displaying 3 different time and day options that all (or at the v least more than half of the team + 1) are able to meet. This could be either virtual or irl.

"Task" Creation 
  - Being able to add a task is a basic and core feature of any planning/scheduling system, AmbIance allows you to select a priority level, the deadline of said task, a category and assign a time trackability feature (which then data can be compiled to track user success). Location restriction.

"Schedule" Integration 
  - Allows you to import other calendars either that already exist OutlookCalendar, Google Calendar, etc + adding work/internship/organization schedule into the master Schedule, so all your events and tasks in one place.
  
 "Study Search" Collaborative Feature
  - Filters users in the same course to allow them to find each other for study purposes.
  
 "Teams/Group/Club Meeting Creator"
  -Takes calendar from members in an organization to provide meeting options to maximize member attendance/participation.
  
  
  Goal: Helps users like us (overwhelmed, overworked, and exhausted yet ambitious college students), to automate the burden of their responsability by dealing with all the energy-draining issues as coordinating between several group members a meeting time, finding time to complete school load, etc..  Additionallu well as enabling users to add a wide of range of tasks that reflect revelant areas outside of school for the user, such as work/internship, personal/social events, and more.
